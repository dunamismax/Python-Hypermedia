# Hypermedia Stack Project Ideas

This document provides an exhaustive list of potential application and website ideas perfectly suited for development with **The Python Hypermedia Stack**. These projects emphasize server-side rendering, minimal JavaScript, and leverage the power of FastAPI, HTMX, Jinja2, SQLModel, asyncpg, and Pico.css. They are excellent for learning, building a strong portfolio, and demonstrating proficiency with modern Python web development.

## Core CRUD Applications

These projects focus on fundamental Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, providing a solid foundation for understanding the stack.

1.  **Advanced Task Manager:** Beyond a simple to-do list, include features like categories, due dates, priorities, user authentication, and filtering/sorting. Implement drag-and-drop reordering using HTMX extensions.
2.  **Personal Blog/CMS:** A full-featured blogging platform with user authentication, post creation/editing (Markdown support), comments, tags, categories, and an admin interface. Demonstrate dynamic content loading for comments or post lists.
3.  **Recipe Book:** Manage recipes with ingredients, instructions, categories, and search functionality. Allow users to add/edit recipes and mark favorites. Implement dynamic ingredient lists or step-by-step instructions.
4.  **Simple E-commerce Storefront:** Display products, manage a shopping cart (server-side), and a simplified checkout process. Focus on dynamic updates to cart totals and product availability without full page reloads.
5.  **Personal Finance Tracker:** Track income and expenses, categorize transactions, and generate basic reports (e.g., monthly summaries). Implement dynamic filtering of transactions by date or category.

## Interactive Dashboards & Monitoring

Leverage HTMX for real-time or near real-time updates to create dynamic and responsive dashboards.

6.  **System Monitoring Dashboard:** Display real-time CPU, memory, disk usage, and network activity. Use HTMX polling or server-sent events (SSE) for live updates of system metrics.
7.  **IoT Device Dashboard:** If you have access to IoT devices or can simulate data, build a dashboard to display sensor readings (temperature, humidity) and potentially control devices (e.g., toggle a light). Dynamic charts and controls are key.
8.  **Website Analytics Dashboard:** Integrate with a simple analytics backend (or mock data) to display website traffic, page views, and user behavior. Implement dynamic date range selection and data filtering.

## Social & Community Platforms

Build interactive platforms that facilitate user interaction and content sharing.

9.  **Microblogging Platform:** A simplified Twitter clone where users can post short messages, follow others, like posts, and view a personalized feed. Focus on dynamic updates for likes, follows, and new posts.
10. **Forum/Discussion Board:** Create a multi-topic forum where users can create new threads, post replies, and engage in discussions. Implement dynamic loading of replies and new thread creation.
11. **Event Management System:** Allow users to create events, RSVP, view attendee lists, and send notifications. Dynamic updates for RSVP counts and event details.

## Utility Applications

Practical tools that demonstrate specific functionalities and interactions.

12. **URL Shortener:** A service to shorten long URLs, track clicks, and provide basic analytics. Dynamic display of click counts and URL management.
13. **Pastebin/Code Snippet Sharing:** Allow users to paste and share code snippets with syntax highlighting. Implement dynamic loading of snippets and search functionality.
14. **Markdown Editor with Live Preview:** A web-based Markdown editor that renders the Markdown to HTML in real-time as the user types. This is a classic HTMX use case.
15. **Simple File Uploader/Manager:** Allow users to upload files, view a list of uploaded files, and download them. Implement dynamic file list updates and progress indicators for uploads.

## Simple Web-Based Games

Explore interactive elements and server-side game logic.

16. **Text Adventure Game:** Build a more complex text-based adventure game where all game logic and state management reside on the server. HTMX handles the user input and updates the game narrative dynamically.
17. **Quiz Application:** Create a multiple-choice quiz application with scoring, question navigation, and result display. All question logic and scoring are handled server-side.
18. **Turn-Based Board Game:** Implement a simple turn-based game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four. The game board state is managed on the server, and HTMX updates the board after each player's move.
