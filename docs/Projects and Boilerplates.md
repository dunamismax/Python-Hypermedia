### Projects and Boilerplates

- **[fastapi-htmx-picocss-example](https://github.com/dunamismax/fastapi-htmx-picocss-example)**: An extensive and well-documented example of an IoT dashboard. It's a great starting point that integrates FastAPI, HTMX, and Pico.css. It uses Jinja2 for templating and demonstrates a pure hypermedia approach.

- **[fastapi-template-uv](https://github.com/barabum0/fastapi-template-uv)**: A project template for FastAPI that comes pre-configured with `uv` for package management and `Ruff` for linting and formatting. It's an excellent choice for starting a new project with a modern, fast development toolchain.

- **[FastAPI-HTMX-BoilerPlate](https://github.com/Hybridhash/FastAPI-HTMX)**: This boilerplate is a strong foundation for applications that require user authentication and management. It includes features for handling users, roles, and groups, complete with RESTful endpoints and HTMX-powered templates.

- **[fastapi-sqlmodel-alembic-htmx](https://github.com/valentinschabschneider/fastapi-sqlmodel-alembic-htmx)**: A sample project focused on the backend, demonstrating the use of FastAPI with SQLModel for ORM and Alembic for handling database migrations.

- **[uv-fastapi-example](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-fastapi-example)**: An official example from Astral (the creators of `uv` and `Ruff`) that showcases how to manage a FastAPI application as a `uv` project.

These repositories offer practical, real-world examples that can help you learn and apply the technologies in your stack effectively.
